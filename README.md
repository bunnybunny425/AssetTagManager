Asset Tag Manager

Problem:
Create a simple asset tag management system where users can:
View a list of assets with their associated tags.
Add/remove tags from assets.
Have certain tags auto-generate based on asset metadata (e.g., if an asset's manufacturer is 'Dell', automatically add 'Dell' as a tag).
Group and color-code tags by category (e.g., manufacturer tags in blue, status tags in green).
The system should include:.
A React frontend with a clean, modern UI.
A simple backend API with 2-3 endpoints.
Basic tag categorization logic.
Real-time tag updates.

Run:

```
  cd backend
  npm install
  npm start
```

```
  cd frontend
  npm install
  npm start
```

Take a look at http://localhost:3000/ for the frontend!
